<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
It&#8217;s a curious thing that whenever someone gets in trouble because of 
their actions, they blame it on bad luck. Clearly, they say, it wasn&#8217;t 
my fault that I lied, that I stole, that I became an alcoholic, that I 
was stupid! No, it was all the fault of bad luck, bad horoscopes, bad 
omens. I wish you would talk a little about that, because it is 
ridiculously common for people to attempt to evade responsibility by 
blaming fate, luck, anything but themselves. Even my father blames fate 
for his recent misfortunes, not those truly at fault. I happen to be a 
good match for my own sign, but really, it has nothing to do with who I 
am and I know it. I would be the same even if I was born at a completely
 different time, even if I was supposed to be virtuous and modest. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Almost</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Almost,<br>
Your letter is certainly very rational, and in many ways, I agree. 
People have always found ways to evade responsibility, if not by blaming
 others, then by blaming fate. Life is easier that way. From what you 
say, your main problem seems to be with your father refusing to blame 
someone who is at fault and blaming bad luck instead. But are you 
certain that the people are indeed at fault? You are very harsh on your 
father; must you be proud and pitiless towards him, simply because you 
are more logical in one thing? That makes little sense. You imply that 
you believe you are not &#8216;virtuous and modest&#8217;. Are you, perhaps, one of 
the people you think your father should blame? 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My husband and I just got married, and almost right away, he got into a 
fight with my cousin. It was my cousin&#8217;s fault, as far as I can tell, 
but unfortunately, my first instinct was to blame my husband. I don&#8217;t 
know how I could have possibly thought it of him, knowing both of them 
as I do. I know I have betrayed him - of all the people in the world, he
 should at least be able to rely on his newlywed wife to trust him! I 
have betrayed him, and with everyone else blaming him, too. How can I 
possibly make amends, Abby?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Auburn</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Auburn,<br>
While I agree that your first loyalty should be to your husband, I think
 you are being too harsh on yourself. You haven&#8217;t been married long; it 
makes sense that your instincts are still to side with family over your 
husband. If it was only a passing thought, I don&#8217;t think it matters much
 at all, especially if you didn&#8217;t tell anyone. It&#8217;s obvious you care 
about your husband very much, so don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re mired with infamy 
because of one thought. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I am in love with a man who will never return my love. It&#8217;s just 
impossible. He&#8217;s from a rich family, accepted in the highest ranks of 
society, whereas I&#8217;m a doctor&#8217;s daughter. In other words, nobody, 
compared to him. He has never even noticed me. It&#8217;s true that his mother
 has been very kind to me, practically bringing me up after my father 
died, but that barely improves things - if she found out about my love, 
she might start hating me. She&#8217;s called me her daughter! That makes my 
love practically incestuous. What can I do?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Aurora</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Aurora,<br>
First of all, calm down. Just because his mother thinks of you as a 
daughter doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s your brother, and it doesn&#8217;t make your love 
incest. It may actually be in your favor, since his family knows and 
likes you already. It&#8217;s true, however, that revealing your feelings at 
this point would cause a lot of problems. What you need, if you really 
want him to like you, is some way to level the field a little, to make 
the status difference not matter. Let him get to know you better so that
 he doesn&#8217;t care about it, or perhaps find a way to better your own 
position. It&#8217;s possible that the best solution is simply to forget about
 him and find yourself someone else. But whatever you do, remember this 
above all: be true to yourself, and do not lie to yourself about your 
feelings.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
There is a guy who I really fancy, and the more I see of him, the more I
 like him. But I&#8217;m worried that if I say yes the first time he asks me 
out, he&#8217;ll just get bored of me quickly and dump me. Boys seem to enjoy 
pursuing a girl more than they enjoy actually being in a relationship, 
and they seem to prize a girl more if they had to go to a lot of trouble
 to get her to accept them. So I plan to not show that I like him until 
he is really desperate. Do you think this will work?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Blushful</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Blushful,<br>
While it&#8217;s sadly true that many men prefer girls they need to work to 
get, many others do not. You can&#8217;t know which category he belongs to. If
 you make him wait too long, he might lose interest altogether and find a
 different girl. If he finds out you are manipulating him, not genuinely
 uninterested, he may be angry at you. And most importantly, even if 
things work out, you will have wasted a lot of time that you could have 
spent together. Life is short enough as is, and you never know when 
something may happen. If you waste it like this, you may find that the 
fault is not in the stars but in yourself when your time together ends. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I have recently come to an interesting conclusion: that, really, 
everyone wants to commit suicide, and the only reason they do not is 
because they are too frightened of what comes next. If we could be 
certain that death is only like sleep, and a dreamless sleep at that, 
then no one would stay alive for long. After all, everyone has some sort
 of burden in their life, whether it&#8217;s sickness, bad luck in love, 
troubles with the law, or a boss who is a bully. It&#8217;s only our own 
cowardice that keeps us from killing ourselves. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Candid</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Candid,<br>
An interesting conclusion indeed! Most would say it was not cowardice 
but courage, to stay alive in the face of everything. And while many 
people do feel an urge to kill themselves occasionally, I do not think 
you are right to say that everyone does all the time. It is a temptation
 to say that everyone thinks the way you would in their place: after 
all, we are human, we all bleed when we are pricked. But minds are far 
more complicated than bodies, in some ways, and not nearly as 
predictable. Don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, but I would recommend that 
you see a therapist. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
There&#8217;s this man that lives in this city, and he&#8217;s going to take it over
 if no one stops him. He&#8217;s no better than any of us, but you can&#8217;t tell 
that by the way he acts or by the way the whole city worships him. I 
hate his guts, but that&#8217;s not important. What&#8217;s important is that there 
are those in the city that could thwart him from taking over, but they 
are doing nothing, because they are his personal friends, or because 
they don&#8217;t care about their principles as much as people used to, or 
because they love him so much they don&#8217;t care. And so it will be our own
 fault if we do not stop him. I am determined to do whatever it takes.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Crowded</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Crowded,<br>
I am not so certain that it is not important that you hate this man. It 
may be that you overestimate the danger to your city if he does &#8216;take 
over&#8217; or that you overestimate the chances that he will do so; and it is
 definitely possible that you will do something you will regret if you 
do &#8216;whatever it takes&#8217;. Think about it. Make sure what you do is 
actually the best thing to be done. That being said, I&#8217;m glad you are 
not simply giving up. Too many people in difficult situations simply 
choose executors and talk of wills. You intend to fight, and I am glad 
of that. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I have recently been asked multiple times why I pursue a certain course 
of action when it cannot possibly profit me. I would like to make my 
answer public. 
There is a man who has made me a laughing stock repeatedly, thwarted my 
business plans, helped my enemies, and harmed my friends, all because he
 is a prejudiced bigot. Are we not all human? Do we not all have eyes, 
and hands, and thoughts, and feelings? We all eat, we all get sick, we 
all die, and so, since we are so similar, I will make another 
similarity: we all get revenge on those that wrong us. I have the 
opportunity now to get even with him, and I will show him that we are 
not as different as he thought, that he and those like him have taught 
us how to get revenge. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Defence</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Defence,<br>
The best thing to do with bigots is to ignore them and prove them wrong 
by your actions, though this can be difficult. Revenge is a tempting 
idea, but in practice it often comes out wrong. I can see that you want 
to make sure this man gets the just proportion of your sorrow, but do 
you really want to be like him? Think carefully, and don&#8217;t do anything 
you&#8217;ll regret later.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
Me and my husband have been fighting recently. He is terribly jealous, 
and whenever I go anywhere with a certain male friend of mine, he turns 
up and starts an argument. It doesn&#8217;t matter where we go - the sea, a 
garden, a mountain - he still turns up and claims that my friend is my 
lover! Not that he&#8217;s faithful to me himself, the hypocrite. And all of 
this is not even the root cause of our quarrel. 
As if this wasn&#8217;t enough, there are hundreds of people who are harmed 
while we fight, because we both have great influence. The consequences 
have been severe - flooding, sickness, bad harvest...
I am in the right, and he is in the wrong. I will not give in, but I do 
so want to end this mess! How can we do that, Abby?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Discord</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Discord,<br>
It is very rare that the truth is all on one side in an argument between
 husband and wife. Think carefully: are you sure that you aren&#8217;t also at
 fault? You didn&#8217;t give me the details so I can&#8217;t know for certain, but I
 suspect it is less straightforward than you think. If the consequences 
have been so severe, you need to make up now, before more people get 
hurt, even if it means sacrificing your pride. Do not prove false 
traitor to yourself by continuing a fight you don&#8217;t want. This, of 
course, is assuming that you do want to stay together and fix things, as
 you say. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My cousin&#8217;s fiance just dumped her at the altar. Literally. He 
purposefully humiliated her, said she&#8217;d cheated on him, and that he 
would not marry her. If I was only a boy, I&#8217;d be able to fight him, beat
 him up until he begged for her forgiveness. I wish I could be a man, 
just for this, or at least that I had some friend that would do it for 
me, but there is only one man I am on good enough terms with to ask, and
 he is the damn liar&#8217;s best friend. How can I make sure that the bastard
 doesn&#8217;t get away with it?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Helpless</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Helpless,<br>
Your feeling for your cousin does you credit, but I doubt that beating 
up her ex will actually do any good. It&#8217;s natural to think so, of 
course: he hurt someone you love, and you want to retaliate. I&#8217;m sure if
 you really try, you&#8217;ll find a way to punish him even if you can&#8217;t beat 
him up. But does your cousin want it? And what will it accomplish? It&#8217;s 
unlikely to bring him back to her, even if she still wants him, or prove
 to anyone that she didn&#8217;t cheat on him. So quench your fiery 
indignation, give your cousin a shoulder to cry on and a caring ear, and
 help her move on.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I gave my boyfriend a present when he moved away temporarily, so that he
 wouldn&#8217;t forget me while I wasn&#8217;t there. Then I saw how much I missed 
him, and decided to go visit. When I arrived, I saw that he wasn&#8217;t 
missing me at all: he was busy trying to catch another girl&#8217;s attention!
 I decided to disguise myself, and when he saw me, not only did he not 
recognize me, he asked me to take the other girl a message and a gift. 
The gift being the same gift I gave him, and the message being that he 
asked her out again. And he asked me to try and put in a good word for 
him. Honestly, I almost felt sorry for him: he didn&#8217;t know how unlikely 
his errand was to succeed with such a messenger. Still, I promised him I
 would try, even though that&#8217;s the last thing I want to do. What should I
 do?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Mimic</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Mimic,<br>
I&#8217;m sorry, but your boyfriend really doesn&#8217;t seem to be worth your time.
 In circumstances like these, I would advise you to end the 
relationship. Tell him the truth - that you know that he&#8217;s been cheating
 on you. If he actually does care about you, then maybe when he finds 
out you know, you can fix things. Chances are, though, that this is the 
end.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br> 
Many years ago, I made some enemies. I don&#8217;t want to talk about what 
they did to me, my husband, and my son, but the important part is that 
now, after years of pain, I am finally seeing them receive the same. You
 see, the youngest son in that family is a high-functioning psychopath, 
and he has clawed his way up in the heap of their family enterprise, 
going through his brothers and nephews on the way. In fact, his mother 
and sister-in-law are now in precisely the same position I am! I 
couldn't resist gloating to them about it all - after all, they were all
 for the psychopath when he was going after my family. The coincidence 
of names is especially beautiful: their sons, who have now become his 
victims, were both named Edward, just like my son! It is a beautifully 
symmetric situation, and it proves to me there is indeed justice in the 
world. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Nihilist </div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Nihilist,<br>
Seeing bad things happen to those you hate can be exhilarating, 
especially when the punishment seems to fit the crime. But at the same 
time, it is very easy to let this feeling slip to those who haven&#8217;t done
 you any harm, or to let it dominate your life. You have been holding on
 to your hate for years; isn&#8217;t it time to let go? Don&#8217;t you feel it&#8217;s 
not as sweet now as it was before? 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I am in love with a woman that doesn&#8217;t love me at all, and nothing I do 
changes her mind. I have tried to change what I feel, but nothing works.
 When you listen to music over and over again, you get tired of it, you 
don&#8217;t like it as much as you did at first. Why doesn&#8217;t the same thing 
happen when you are in love, and you think about the same person all the
 time? Is it because our imaginations are so fruitful that the thoughts 
change all the time? They say music is akin to love, and I&#8217;ve tried to 
pour my love into music, but all that happened was that I got really 
sick of music.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Offkey</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Offkey,<br>
The only thing you can do is wait. Try to find yourself something 
different to do, to distract yourself from thinking about her. Find new 
people to talk to. Find other women. (Though don&#8217;t lead them to expect 
any commitment until you know you can give it to them.) Music was a good
 idea, but it&#8217;s not the only worthwhile thing out there. There is no 
end, limit, or measure to the things you can accomplish if you really 
try. Sooner or later, you will suddenly realize that your feelings have 
faded. Just don&#8217;t keep asking her to change her mind. It sounds like she
 knows what she wants, and it isn&#8217;t you.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My best friend was trying to do something terrible to me. He has always 
been very kind, and I have been kind to him, but he works for someone 
who hates me, and he&#8217;s got new instructions. I couldn&#8217;t believe it at 
first, but he was determined to follow orders, despite our friendship. I
 begged him for a long time, and finally, he relented, said he couldn&#8217;t 
do it, and promised to hide me. But can I trust him, Abby? I do, but 
what if it&#8217;s just my youth speaking? Am I being naive?
<div class="sig">&#8212;Pitied</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Pitied,<br>
I think you can probably trust him for now, but be careful. It sounds 
like you need him, but don&#8217;t rely on him unconditionally. He almost put 
his employer before your friendship once, so next time, he might go 
through with it. On the other hand, he would probably get in trouble if 
his boss found out he helped you, so he&#8217;ll do his best not to let that 
happen. It&#8217;s difficult to say how genuine his friendship is without 
knowing him, so let me not name him untrustworthy, but do watch him, and
 be careful.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I&#8217;m not writing to try and get some kind of false comfort from your 
answer, I just want to be able to tell someone how miserable I am. Until
 last week, I was the boss of a successful company. But when I went away
 on holiday, my chief competitor took the opportunity to launch a 
hostile takeover. He has even managed to convince my Board of Directors 
to back him. I should be using this time to sort out my financial 
position, except thanks to my competitor, I can&#8217;t even do that! I guess I
 shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. When I think about it, lots of leaders get 
backstabbed by people jealous of them. Some have even been murdered to 
gain control of a company! It seems like becoming successful just makes 
you a target for disaster! I still have the title, for now, but it seems
 ridiculous when anyone uses it. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Pitiful</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Pitiful,<br>
I&#8217;m sorry that this has happened to you, and that you don&#8217;t think you 
can be helped. It looks like you&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the 
progeny of evils that comes from being successful; perhaps you should 
think more about what you can do about it? As things are, you&#8217;re 
intending to just give up, and that means things will only get worse.

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
All my life I&#8217;ve lived on a small island, and I know it better than 
anyone else. It is a strange island, with strange sounds sometimes, like
 instruments playing, or voices singing, music that makes you cry, and 
if you sleep, to have strange dreams. Recently, we got some visitors, 
and talking to them made me remember the times when my mother and I were
 the only ones that lived here. I wish the other guy that lives here 
would go away - he ruined everything when he came. Do you think I could 
get the visitors to get rid of him for me? 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Poor-boy</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Poor-boy,<br>
It sound like you really love your home, and it&#8217;s understandable that 
you want an intruder to leave, but how exactly do you envision getting 
rid of him? It sounds like he&#8217;s been there for a while, and presumably 
you&#8217;ve tried to get him to leave before. Even if he were approved in the
 height a villain, you&#8217;d need help to kick him out, and more reliable 
help than random visitors at that. You&#8217;d need to prove he had no right 
to be on the island, and help from the authorities. Perhaps you need to 
make your peace with him. Ask yourself if there is anything you have 
done that is as bad as what he has done, see if you can talk to him. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My sister is married to a man that seemed to love her passionately, and 
she was happy in her marriage, until today. Today, he was late to 
dinner, and she asked him to come quickly. And what do you think he 
responded? He said he did not know who she was, and why she was 
bothering him! And after dinner, when she went to her room to rest, do 
you know what he did? He started hitting on me! I don&#8217;t know what to 
think now. Perhaps he married my sister for money, and is now showing 
his true colors, but in that case, he would at least pretend to still 
love her to her face. If he no longer loves her, isn&#8217;t that enough hurt 
without going out of his way to demonstrate it? I wish he would hide it,
 pretend nothing has changed, let her think that he still loves her. It 
would be more merciful. I told him so. He answered that he owed her 
nothing and that she was not his wife. I am now seriously concerned for 
his sanity.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Secrecy</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Secrecy,<br>
If I were you, I would be concerned too. It certainly sounds like your 
brother-in-law needs help, preferably as soon as possible. It&#8217;s very 
rare for mental illness to set on suddenly in adulthood like this, so 
try talking to his parents and friends to see if he has had episodes 
like this before. Perhaps this is the effect of a drug. Perhaps it&#8217;s 
even just misguided humor. Get him to sit down with someone removed from
 the situation, preferably a therapist, but in any case a person that 
can talk to him without getting emotional, and see if you can figure out
 exactly how bad the situation is. And be not afeared: there are 
professionals that can help him, and support structures for your sister.
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby</div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br> 
My daughter has done something terrible. She denies it, but the proof is
 overwhelming. I find myself wishing she would die, so that I wouldn&#8217;t 
have to bear the shame of it. I was so proud of her, I loved her so 
much, and now I wish she had never been born. To think I grieved that 
she was my only child! One too many, now! She has betrayed everything, 
and nothing she can do can fix it. No one will want to know her now, 
much less marry her. I only wish I could blame it on someone else. If 
she was adopted, I could say that these are the bad genes coming out, 
but as it is... Best that she would die, truly. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Spirits </div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Spirits,<br>
It is surely a little too much to wish your daughter dead? If she has 
shamed you, as you say, then she should probably go away for a time, 
perhaps for a long time. If the memory of what has happened  does not 
fade, perhaps she shouldn&#8217;t return, and you should tell some story to 
hide why she isn&#8217;t coming back. And perhaps she is indeed innocent, as 
she says. But above all, remember, if she did this, it was her choice. 
There was no heavenly compulsion forcing her to do anything. And she&#8217;s 
an adult - it&#8217;s not your fault. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Abby </div></div>

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My wife has been cheating on me. I am certain of it, and it is reason 
enough for me to kill her - otherwise things will only get worse. If she
 lives, she will betray others, but she is so lovely that I don&#8217;t want 
to spill her blood. I must kill her, though I love her, because she is 
not truly what she appears, not truly the one I love, and I can love her
 just as well after I kill her. 
<div class="sig">&#8212;Unhappy</div></div>

<div class="response">Dear Unhappy,<br>
I wish you had written me about all of this earlier, because then the 
police would have caught up with you before you killed your wife. 
Unfortunately, it took them too long to trace back your letter - too 
long both for her and for you.
Your story is a perfect example of why it is important to trust the 
people you love. As it turned out, your wife was completely innocent and
 faithful. If you had not been so suspicious, you would have known that 
she loved you before her family and next to high heaven. If you had 
talked to her before you condemned her, she would still be alive. And if
 you decided not to trust her, but not to kill her either, you could 
have fixed things after you found out she was innocent.

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
I recently met a young man that was in love with a young girl who didn&#8217;t
 want to ever see him again. He was very sweet and kind to her, and she 
told him to go away and not bother her, obviously thinking a lot of 
herself. I lost my temper. I told her what I thought - that she wasn&#8217;t 
nearly as pretty as she thought and that she should be grateful for the 
love of a good man. And I told him what I thought, too - that by 
following her like that, he was flattering her and inflating her opinion
 of herself, even though he was a far better person, and better-looking 
as well! And then the stupid girl went and started to fall in love with 
me! I tried to tell her that none of her charms could make me possibly 
fall in love with her, but she wouldn&#8217;t listen! Even though the idea is 
utterly absurd! She doesn&#8217;t really know who I am, and if she did, she 
would definitely not be in love with me! Abby, what now?

<div class="response">Dear Upcaught,<br>
First of all, I want to point out something you probably already 
noticed: that if you hadn&#8217;t interfered in the first place, you wouldn&#8217;t 
be in this position. We can&#8217;t fix everything that we see is going wrong,
 and sometimes we shouldn&#8217;t try. 
That being said, your situation is not actually that bad. Yes, it&#8217;s 
awkward, but it&#8217;s much more so for the girl. She, after all, has a crush
 on you and cares what you think of her, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be 
anything good. You just have to let her down gently. Be nice; even if 
you dislike her, don&#8217;t let her read it in your eye. Don&#8217;t string her 
along, either; just tell her you don&#8217;t like her that way, and leave it 
at that. Unless, of course, you do want to give it a try after all, 
which you seem to have ruled out completely, and you may be right.

<div class="letter">Dear Abby,<br>
My son just left to go abroad for a time. I gave him a lot of advice 
before he left. The usual stuff: think before you act, hold on to your 
true friends, avoid getting into fights but stand up for yourself if you
 do, listen more than you speak, and so on. And don&#8217;t trust people you 
don&#8217;t really know. Don&#8217;t borrow money or let others borrow yours. You 
know. 
I&#8217;m still worried about him, though. What if he starts drinking? Or 
gambling? Or sleeping around? Maybe I should send someone to check up on
 him.

It is natural for a father to worry about his son and to want to do 
everything possible for him. If you could, you would offer love's full 
sacrifice for him. But you can&#8217;t. He is a grown man, and there is very 
little you can do for him except give him advice, which you have already
 done, and let him go, which you have also done. There is nothing else 
you can do. Let him make his own mistakes.
