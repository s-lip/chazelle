<p class="c2"><span>Well, it&#8217;s World Series time again.
&#160;In our first round we&#8217;ll start close to home
with</span> <span class="c8">East End Rules</span><span>, 6th
edition. &#160;Only rail lines are in play, and please make sure to
have enough money for an unannounced exit fare increase.
&#160;Graeme has the first move.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">All right, since we&#8217;re playing
East End Rules, the logical place to start is the East End, but
since there isn&#8217;t one in this city, I&#8217;ll go to</span>
<span class="c5 c6">Aquarium</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#8217;ll cross under the harbor
and take the western approach.</span> <span class="c0 c6">Maverick.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Hmmm...take the Green Line over the
dam...beavers build dams...so instead I&#8217;ll cross the
Longfellow Bridge to</span> <span class="c3 c6">Kendall/MIT</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Let&#8217;s go back to the dam and
move to Lechmere.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Sorry, that&#8217;s not a valid
move.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">No? Tim was at Kendall...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>According to our sources</span><span>, that
move isn&#8217;t technically allowed.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Oh, I see. &#160;</span><span class="c1 c6">Tufts Medical Center</span><span class="c1">,
then.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Revere Beach</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Back across the harbor to</span>
<span class="c0 c6">Harvard</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3 c6">Downtown
Crossing</span><span class="c3">...oh, that puts me in trouble,
doesn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It certainly does. &#160;You left
open the diagonal crossing of the four central stations.
&#160;</span><span class="c1 c6">Government
Center</span><span class="c1">!</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>This round may look like the last round, at
least by the signage, but it&#8217;ll soon be clear that
you&#8217;re in a whole other country. &#160;We&#8217;ll be
using</span> <span class="c8">Kamprad&#8217;s Skip-Stop Variation
No. 10</span><span>. To assist you we&#8217;ve provided
pictographic instruction sheets and allen keys. &#160;Willie, as
the last game&#8217;s winner, you have the first move.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thank you, Humphrey. &#160;Well the
first picture says I should start with the bit that goes in the
middle...I think they mean</span> <span class="c1 c6">T-Centralen</span><span class="c1">, so I&#8217;ll head
there.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Okay, this gets nailed to the back
of it, shunt the lateral and go to</span> <span class="c5 c6">Fridhemsplan</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#8217;s quite the cunning plan
Fridhem had, but not as cunning as</span> <span class="c0 c6">Odenplan</span><span class="c0">!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>[All groan]</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Put in the dowels, then attach this
screw thing...</span> <span class="c3 c6">H&#246;torget</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c6">Gamla stan</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6">Mariatorget</span><span class="c5">. Pass the lingonberry sauce, would you?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Almost there. &#160;Now this shelf
goes on top, taking us to</span> <span class="c0 c6">Hornstull</span><span class="c0">...where&#8217;s this
piece go?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3 c6">Midsommarkransen</span><span class="c3">&#160;and we have
ourselves a dresser!</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Moving along. &#160;This round will be played
by the</span> <span class="c8">Linear Standard
Version</span><span>, with all trains running as if it were
precisely 7 o&#8217;clock on a Thursday morning. &#160;Shuttles are
out of bounds and note that some lines may have been damaged by the
sandstorm...or some sort of sandy storm. &#160;Tim won the last
round, so we&#8217;ll start with Barry.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">How does that work?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#8217;s the Linear Standard
Version, after all. (starts humming)</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Wouldn&#8217;t that mean I have the
first move?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Look, the rules say it&#8217;s Barry&#8217;s
turn, and even if they don&#8217;t, I say it&#8217;s Barry&#8217;s
turn, so get on with it!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">(humming)...to go to Sugar Hill way
up in Harlem...well, I&#8217;ll stay on a little past there and go
to</span> <span class="c0 c6">Inwood-207th
Street</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s how
the song goes.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">It&#8217;s Thursday morning, so
I&#8217;ll head to</span> <span class="c3 c6">Brighton
Beach</span><span class="c3">&#160;to brush up on my Russian.
&#160;We&#8217;re going to Moscow in a few rounds, after
all.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thanks for the spoiler alert,
Tim.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">What? They announced the rounds in
advance, didn&#8217;t you get the email?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bah, you and your newfangled
technology...I&#8217;ll just content myself by visiting my fellow
fossils at</span> <span class="c1 c6">81st Street-Museum of Natural
History</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hm...</span> <span class="c5 c6">Norwood-205th Street</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Jamaica-Van
Wyck</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3 c6">Roosevelt
Island</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Are you going by the tram or the
subway?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I have a choice? The tram,
it&#8217;s more scenic.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>You&#8217;re not allowed to take the
tram.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The subway, then. &#160;Why did you
ask in the first place?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Never mind, you&#8217;re at Roosevelt Island
and it&#8217;s Willie&#8217;s turn.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I change to the Five and take it all
the way to</span> <span class="c1 c6">Bowling
Green</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Isn&#8217;t that in Ohio, near
Toledo?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, it&#8217;s in Manhattan and
Toledo is in Spain, nowhere near it.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">My mistake. &#160;So next I&#8217;ll
take the shuttle to Grand Central--</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Weren&#8217;t you listening? The
shuttles are out of bounds!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Ugh...divert back downtown,
backtracking all the way and take the Four to</span> <span class="c5 c6">Grand Central-42nd Street</span><span class="c5">. Happy
now?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#8217;ll go to</span> <span class="c0 c6">Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">A few months ago we&#8217;d have to
go much further for a victory condition, but since the storm cut
off the A south of Howard Beach, I can short-circuit the round by
taking a boat across Jamaica Bay and take the H (which, because it
has its own letter, is not considered a shuttle under the Linear
Standard) to </span><span class="c3 c6">Beach 44th Street</span><span class="c3">&#160;to win.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Impressive play, well
done.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Welcome back. &#160;This game will be played by
the traditional</span> <span class="c8">Rules of the 3rd Count of
Paris</span><span>, with all necessary modifications to bring it up
to date with the last few centuries of advancements. &#160;Wine and
cheese will be served after the round is finished. &#160;Graeme has
the first move.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Seeing how we are playing in France,
I think it is only appropriate to begin at</span> <span class="c5 c6">Malesherbes.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Appropriate? How is it appropriate
to begin with a guillotined statesman?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">He was very well liked. Quite
popular there.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">What about the whole chopping off
his head incident?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Well sure, but other than the whole
being decapitated situation, I&#8217;m sure he was quite a
respectable fellow.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Will you stop your bickering
already? It&#8217;s my turn. I&#8217;m going to</span> <span class="c0 c6">Temple.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Temple? I don&#8217;t think any
amount of time at the temple would have saved Malesherbes from the
guillotine.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Enough with the guillotine.
Let&#8217;s go to</span> <span class="c3 c6">Op&#233;ra</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Going to the opera in Paris? Wow,
that&#8217;s creative...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">If this game goes on much longer
I&#8217;ll stick my own head in a guillotine.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ok, my turn.</span> <span class="c1 c6">Gare de l'Est.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aha! You have fallen for my
trap!</span> <span class="c5 c6">Saint-Germain-des-Pr&#233;s!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rats, I should have seen that
coming. Now where can we get some croissants?</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>It appears our lovely scorekeeper Samantha
hasn&#8217;t been keeping a proper count of the points. &#160;For
the record, we are not awarding any points in this series.
&#160;The following round is to use the</span> <span class="c8">Watergate Crossover Rules, as amended by the 4th General
Session</span><span>. &#160;Players are reminded not to break into
any office buildings unless they are completely sure nobody is
looking. &#160;Graeme, as the previous game&#8217;s winner, moves
first.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Again? I feel cheated.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Ah, Washington, DC. We&#8217;ve
played here quite a bit, so let&#8217;s go against the flow this
time.</span> <span class="c5 c6">Clarendon.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&#8217;s see... You&#8217;ve left
me quite a few choices. This move could have quite a big impact on
the game. I might need some time to think and debate the
possibilities...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Just go already, Barry!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Don&#8217;t rush me! Like Washington
crossing the Delaware, this moment could determine the course of
the entire game!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">You do realize that didn&#8217;t
take place in Washington.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Or Delaware.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fine. Let&#8217;s go with...</span>
<span class="c0 c6">Capital South!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Oh great, now it&#8217;s my turn. I
do really have tons of decisions here. I need to seriously weigh
the pros and cons before proceeding. Plus, I can&#8217;t forget
about how my choice will affect my image. After all, image is
everything in Washington.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You realize you can&#8217;t
filibuster yourself out of moving.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, actually, I&#8217;m pretty
sure that self-filibustering is a totally acceptable practice
here.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Really? Well in that case, maybe I
should take a bit more time to think. Can I form a
committee?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, shape up already!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Shape up? Hmm... shapes... Oh yes,
of course!</span> <span class="c3 c6">Pentagon!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wow, you all are acting like
children.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I see where this one is
going.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c6">L'Enfant Plaza.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Back to me already? Let&#8217;s go
with</span> <span class="c5 c6">Arlington Cemetery.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">In all your bickering, you
overlooked what was right in front of your noses!</span>
<span class="c0 c6">Largo Town Center.</span> <span class="c0">I
win.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>As we near the final round of this tournament,
I remind the players to refrain from questioning the rules, except
when the rules have been found questionable. &#160;This game will
be played by the same rules as</span> <span class="c8">Match Game
&#8216;08</span><span>, except that the rules will in fact be
entirely different. &#160;Punk rock performances in churches may
not technically be legal, but are quite badass nonetheless.
&#160;Barry?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thanks, Humph. Now here&#8217;s the
map...in Russian...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">I hate playing the Moscow version! I
can&#8217;t even spell the names, yet alone pronounce
them!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have this discussion every time.
Let&#8217;s just agree to stick to the transliterated names as
written down in the piece of paper in my pocket.</span>
<span class="c0 c6">Tyoply Stan.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ok, let&#8217;s go with Park
Kultury.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Come on, you know that&#8217;s not
allowed.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Time for the traditional penalty!
Illegal moves require ingesting a gallon of borscht.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">I&#8217;m pretty sure in Moscow you
don&#8217;t eat borscht. In Moscow the borscht eats you.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ugh, really? Those jokes are so
old.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Agreed. New proposition: In Moscow,
we don&#8217;t tell jokes about not doing things in Moscow.
Agreed?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Of course. Because in Moscow, Moscow
tells jokes about not doing things to you.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Will you stop it already! Besides,
I&#8217;m pretty sure you just made up that rule last time we
played here. Let&#8217;s go with</span> <span class="c3 c6">Filyovsky Park.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes! I can pronounce one of those
two words. 50% isn&#8217;t bad. Now I understand why singleton
names aren&#8217;t allowed in this version- more chances to find a
recognizable word. Let&#8217;s try this one on for size:</span>
<span class="c1 c6">Ploshchad Revolyutsii</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Wow, that one is quite a
mouthful.</span> <span class="c5 c6">Ploshchad
Ilyicha</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Terrible, Graeme. That&#8217;s
incredibly boring, but I guess it&#8217;s technically legal.
Let&#8217;s spice things up a bit.</span> <span class="c0 c6">Kuznetsky Most</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Let&#8217;s see now...</span>
<span class="c3 c6">Oktyabrskoye Pole</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I think I have it! Let me check...
yes!</span> <span class="c1 c6">Pyatnitskoye Shosse!</span></p>
<p class="c2 c4"></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>At last, we have reached the final round,
except for the one after this one. &#160;This time, we will play by
the</span> <span class="c8">Fixed Distance Rule</span><span>,
subcategory 2, which may be unfamiliar to you. &#160;I can tell you
I wasn&#8217;t even aware this city had a rail system, let alone
the rules. &#160;Barry is up first.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Oh, come on! I haven&#8217;t started
yet!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>The rules are the rules and it&#8217;s
Barry&#8217;s turn whether you like it or not.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">(grumbles)</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#8217;d start at Hollywood &amp;
Vine, but that&#8217;s such a cliche...besides there&#8217;s more
going on down the street these days, at</span> <span class="c0 c6">Hollywood/Highland</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I was going to start at Hollywood
&amp; Vine, but you blocked that move! Fine,</span> <span class="c3 c6">Vermont/Santa Monica</span><span class="c3">&#160;it
is.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c6">7th Street/Metro
Center</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Let&#8217;s go to</span>
<span class="c5 c6">Washington.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Washington, I thought we were in Los
Angeles?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ah, a tricky move indeed. I see
you&#8217;ve already thoroughly confused Willie. Thankfully, I
studied this opening in great detail on my last visit to Los
Angeles.</span> <span class="c0 c6">Firestone.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">You were in Los Angeles?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Here we go again! He was an extra in
some action movie in 2011 about aliens invading LA or something.
He&#8217;s been blabbering on about it for months.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Oh, you mean Battle: Los Angeles?
Wasn&#8217;t that movie terrible?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Actually, it was Battle of Los
Angeles. The Syfy movie. But it&#8217;s close, right?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ok, let&#8217;s finish this game
already. It&#8217;s not like I have much of a choice of what to
play here. Let&#8217;s see how this goes:</span> <span class="c3 c6">Artesia</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c6">Pacific Coast Highway.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Well, that was awful.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>At last, we come to the finals of the World
Series, to determine who will win the prize, which will as usual
not be awarded. &#160;But before we begin, I see we&#8217;ve
received a surprisingly large amount of mail, namely one postcard
from a Mrs. Trellis of North Wales. &#160;She writes, &#8220;Dear
Manic Sages: Would you please stop explaining how the puzzle works
and get to the actual puzzle already?&#8221; Now it would be unfair
to introduce new rules at this stage, so we&#8217;re just going to
play by the old rules from the other rounds instead. &#160;Only,
er, not simultaneously, as that would be nonsensical, and nonsense
has no place in a game like this. &#160;Your starting position,
appropriately enough, is</span> <span class="c6">Wimbledon</span><span>, and the first move goes to
Tim.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Finally! &#160;Now, let&#8217;s take
a southern lateral approach to</span> <span class="c3 c6">West
Brompton</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Very cautious, almost cowardly move
on your part.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Oh, don&#8217;t give me that,
Graeme, you&#8217;ve made that move a thousand times.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&#8217;ll have to go to</span>
<span class="c1 c6">Parsons Green</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Backing away this
early...that&#8217;s even worse!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I suppose you&#8217;ll be taking
an aggressive attack on this move?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hmm...no, I&#8217;ll just rotate
clockwise to</span> <span class="c5 c6">Wood
Lane</span><span class="c5">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">After all that bluster, a
rotational? Bah, let me show you how it&#8217;s done.
&#160;</span><span class="c0 c6">Euston Square</span><span class="c0">!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Wow, Barry, that&#8217;s quite gutsy
on your part. &#160;I didn&#8217;t think you had it in
you.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">It&#8217;s an indirect adjacency and
quite dangerous all right. &#160;Let&#8217;s see if we can defuse
this situation...head a little bit west to</span> <span class="c3 c6">Ruislip</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">A little bit west? If you&#8217;re
going to head out there, you might as well just go all the way to
Wales! &#160;Let&#8217;s head back in towards</span> <span class="c1 c6">Golders Green</span><span class="c1">&#160;and...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>[buzzer sounds]</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">What? Was that move invalid? Did I
just say the secret word?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>No, nothing of the sort, that sound just means
it&#8217;s time for tea. &#160;We&#8217;ll pick up again
afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="c4 c2"></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Welcome to the exciting second half of the
World Series finals. &#160;Now, our listeners may have lost track
of how the game was going. &#160;I know I certainly have, so
we&#8217;ll start over. &#160;The initial position was a major
sporting venue, I think it was the</span> <span class="c6">Oval</span><span>, and Tim had the first move.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Thanks, Humph. &#160;Er, how about a
transverse crossover to</span> <span class="c3 c6">Barons
Court</span><span class="c3">?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now let&#8217;s take an inward
attack, crossing through the Circle Line and...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Right, right...</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, that won&#8217;t work.</span>
<span class="c1 c6">South Ealing</span><span class="c1">&#160;it
is, then.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Wait, what? That&#8217;s a very
tricky position you put me in.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It certainly is. How are you going
to get out of this one?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">Aha!</span> <span class="c5 c6">Hounslow West</span><span class="c5">!</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hounslow West?! How&#8217;d you get
there?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c5">The long way, through the
airport.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">That can&#8217;t be legal, can it?
Humphrey?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>There&#8217;s no rule against going to Heathrow
needlessly...nobody in their right mind would do it, but this is
Graeme. &#160;The move is valid.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hmmm...that&#8217;s a very unusual
position. &#160;</span><span class="c0 c6">Totteridge &amp;
Whetstone</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">...eight, nine, ten. &#160;Yes,
you&#8217;ve opened up the classic non-indirect transfer via the
Charing Cross branch there. &#160;So that&#8217;s</span>
<span class="c3 c6">Mornington Crescent</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>Well done, Tim! You&#8217;ve won the World
Series, and the nonexistent prize for winning it will not be
presented to you at the closing ceremony. &#160;And to all our
listeners, we hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this competition almost as
much as our non-listeners have enjoyed not listening to it.
&#160;Good night!</span></p>
